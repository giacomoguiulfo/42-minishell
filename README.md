# minishell
### 42 - Project #5 (Unix Branch)

As beautiful as a shell

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn about processes at a basic level by creating a "mini" shell.
This shell is very simple and doesn't need to contain complex functions like piping, redirection and so on.
It contains the following builtins:
```
cd   echo    env    setenv    unsetenv    exit
```
More information can be found on the [PDF].

## How to use it

```
git clone https://github.com/giacomoguiulfo/42-minishell.git
cd 42-minishell
make
./minishell
```

Once in the shell, you can execute the builtins or any other simple command line that works on any other shell.
You can even call minishell from minishell!
